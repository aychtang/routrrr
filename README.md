Find cool places to meet your friends.

Routrrr is a communal map for meeting people. All users who sign in are displayed on the map. If you click anywhere on the map, a bounding box is drawn and searched for cafes within it.

Right now it's built as a simple app to find cafes to meet your friends, if someone you recognise is logged in you can click on their name to draw a searching box straight to them.

###How to use:

- Allow geolocation in browser
- Sign in with google
- Click on the map to draw a bounding box
- You can click on someone you recognise on the top bar to draw a bounding box directly to them

###Maybe in the future:
I'd like to include the following:

- Fully integrate Google Places/Yelp API for better information.
- Aggregate best results in search area.
- Allow people to flag themselves for meeting people they don't know, and connecting them with others using their mobiles.
